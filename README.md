Unsupervised Detection of Patterns from Time Series Data


The propose of this master thesis work that aims to provide an approach that identifies motifs
as well as discords in time series data and ranks them based on frequency of occurrences. Similarity
search is performed using multi-step approach where symbolic representation and approximation is
adopted as a fundamental strategy. Patterns are further narrowed down to produce more accurate
results using distance functions like DTW,Euclidean Distance. We shall reviewed and compared
the state-of-the-art similarity search architectures and visualize the results. Proposed architecture
is empirically compared with the state-of-the-art architecture which demonstrate its performance
improvement, provide fast and precise similarity search result.
